üö¶ Project Overview

This report represents a pioneering quantum-classical hybrid analysis of a key transportation artery in South Carolina‚ÄîSC-123, covering approximately 30 miles from Easley through Clemson to Seneca. This corridor sees frequent urban-rural transition flow, student foot traffic, seasonal weather shifts, and dynamic event congestion (notably Clemson University‚Äôs activity).

The assessment was conducted using quantum-enhanced image interpretation paired with resonance-based hazard prediction, delivered through a simulated pipeline optimized for SCDOT hazard planning, emergency management, and smart infrastructure funding proposals.

üîç Methodology Summary

Color Vector Derivation:

Each scanned image was processed into a 7-dimensional HSV color vector:

3 bins from Hue, 2 from Saturation, 1 from Value

Plus entropy and edge density from grayscale analysis

Vector normalized for signal coherence


Quantum Simulation:

A 7-qubit PennyLane circuit was tuned with the HSV vector:

Each qubit rotated with RY and RZ gates according to the input vector

Circuit passed through a StronglyEntanglingLayer

Final quantum output derived via expectation values of PauliZ operators


Entropy Score:

Defined as the sum of standard deviations from:

1. Color vector variability


2. Quantum output deviation



This scalar provides a numerical index of resonance volatility and hazard forecasting sensitivity.
